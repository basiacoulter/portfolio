                <div class="expertise__description">
                    <p>Product discovery is a foundation of product success. While a number of methods and activities can be employed in the process, I find a discovery workshop to be a useful format to bring together the stakeholders and the product team, and to build a shared understanding around the problem to be solved, the target user group(s), and potential solutions.</p>
                    <p>I leverage Agile <a href="http://jpattonassociates.com/user-story-mapping/" target="_blank">user story mapping</a>, a technique popularized by Jeff Patton, as a tool to quickly unpack an application, to identify user flows and tasks, and to arrive at a defintion of a minimum viable product (MVP).</p>

                    <p>Understanding the needs and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/" target="_blank">mental models</a> of the user base is the necessary foundation for identifying strategy and designing user experience.</p> 
                    <p>Based on the information gathered in conversations with stakeholders and users, competitive landscape reviews, and content audits, I visualize systems as flow charts, system context diagrams, or wireframes to help product teams better understand the intended experience.</p>

                <div class="expertise__description">
                    <p>Establishing information architecture at the onset of a project helps product teams create scalable systems. Keeping in mind end users’ mental models helps design and build products that are easy to use and that support customer retention.</p>
                    <p>I construct systems' information architecture in an iterative process of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/navigation-ia-tests/" target="_blank">testing</a> and refining. Through card sorting, treejack testing, first-click testing, and in-person usability testing, I arrive at taxonomies and information architecture that support user goals and outcomes.</p>

                <div class="expertise__description">
                    <p>Product design is a process of planning and expressing solutions that support business and user goals. Building an experience that works for end users and delivers business value requires an understanding of business objectives, desired user outcomes, and properties of human cognition that power our interactions with the surrounding objects, including digital products.</p>
                    <p>As a communication tool, design functions very much like a language. By tapping into the properties of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/" target="_blank">human perception</a>, and relying on <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">usability heuristics</a>, I design products to communicate function and facilitate seamless user experience.</p>

                <div class="expertise__description">
                    <p class="expertise__description">In the fast-paced reality of modern day software development, and particularly with the adoption of Agile software development methods, design faces unique challenges and has to adapt in order to stay relevant. Strong design leadership and advocacy are needed for design to stand as an equal partner side-by-side with software engineering.</p>
                    <p>I take every opportunity to champion design among software development communities, and to explain its role as a tool that helps bring about market relevance and add business value by supporting user goals and outcomes. I share experience with fellow designers and strategists at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/exploreUX-raleigh/" target="_blank">local meetups</a> and participate in local communities, especially those that focus on women in technology such as <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/raleigh-durham" target="_blank">Women Who Code</a>, <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/raleigh-durham" target="_blank">Girl Develop It</a>, or <a href="http://ladiesthatux.com/durham/" target="_blank">Ladies that UX</a>.</p>
